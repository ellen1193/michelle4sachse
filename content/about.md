Michelle and her family have called Sachse home since 1999. Prior to running for city council, Michelle served as a member and chairwoman of Sachse Zoning Board of Adjustments. She currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Sachse Economic Development Corporation. Michelle has also served in the Collin County Medical Reserve Corps for several years.

Michelle and her husband, Evan, are the parents of four children - one a current student and three graduates of Wylie High School. After staying home with her children for several years, Michelle returned to college and earned a Doctorate of Pharmacy degree from Creighton University. Michelle worked as a pharmacist at Sachse Pharmacy in Sachse before it closed. She currently works as a pharmacist at Infinity Pharmacy, a long term care pharmacy in Richardson.

Michelle and her family believe in serving in the community. They are long term volunteers for the cityâ€™s Red, White and Blue Blast and the Sachse Chamber of Commerce Fallfest. They have planted trees at city hall and throughout the community for Sachse City Arbor Day activities. They have spread mulch and picked up trash at city parks during Sachse Clean Up days. They have also participated in several food drives for the 5 Loaves Food Pantry in Sachse. 

Michelle battles the local clay and attempts to grow a garden every year. Last summer, after growing a bumper crop of cucumbers, she learned to make pickles. Her Habanero Hot Dill pickles won 3rd place at the Texas State Fair in 2017.

Her top priority for the city is to foster economic development in Sachse to reduce the property tax burden on Sachse families.
